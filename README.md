# Multi Language Translator

## Stage 1: Repeater
### Description
Your very first step is writing a program that begins with an invitation message for choosing the translation direction. It then takes the input from your keyboard as an argument and repeats the same process for the word you want to translate.

Here's what youâ€™re going to do:

  * Add the ability to choose the translation direction between two languages (for instance, English and French)
  * Type the word you want to translate

First, you will get a call from the program to choose the mode. Next, you should be asked to enter the word you want to translate. After that, the program should output the information it gathered.

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Type "en" if you want to translate from French into English, or "fr" if you want to translate from English into French:
 fr
Type the word you want to translate:
hello
You chose "fr" as the language to translate "hello" to.
We don't really need this output to appear at the end. However, aside from keeping the user informed, it does something else: it's showing us if the arguments were successfully accepted by the function. Keep it in mind while proceeding from stage to stage!
